# Salary Prediction Project

This repository contains a project focused on predicting salaries based on various features using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the provided dataset, preprocess the data, build a predictive model, and evaluate its performance. The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset and necessary libraries.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data through visualizations and summary statistics.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data for model training.
4. **Model Building**: Training various machine learning models to predict salaries.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models' performance and selecting the best one.
6. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to make salary predictions on new data.
